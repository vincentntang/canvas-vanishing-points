16. Refactoring, part 1 destructuring with spread operator

17. I made it work, two faces with remade formulas. Codes way cleaner now, code golf

22. Working Box and Origin X and Y

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/175896/finding-a-point-along-a-line-a-certain-distance-away-from-another-point

As of now, everything is based on origin (0,0), (400,400) and (800,800)

Fixed it with a math formula from stackexchange
