Canvas Vanishing Points is an experimental project I made, to understand how 3D objects are represented in 2D space, using perspective vanishing points. 

Features
- You can set the size of the box
- You can change the origin vanishing point position
- You can toggle a second vanishing point
- You can adjust spacing between 2 vanishing points
- You can increase the overallsize of the unit.
